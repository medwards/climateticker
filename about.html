<p>We are in the midst of a global climate crisis &#151; a crisis that has already caused the death and/or displacement of millions of people around the world. Every day that our leaders wait to address this mounting crisis and significantly reduce global emissions the greater the death and displacement total becomes.</p>

<p>The climate justice clock is launched as a reminder &#151; a reminder of the people that are lost or forced from their homes while our governments play politics and delay action.</p>

<p>I hope you look at the numbers. That you watch as they increase as the global climate summit in Cancun begins, that you mourn those that have already been lost and that you take action both in your own life, in your communities and in your nation to ensure that we listen to these voices, and ensure they do not go unheard. We must reduce emissions, we must take action, we must push for climate justice.</p>

<p>For more information on how you can act today visit &#151; <a href="http://www.greenpeace.ca/tarsands">www.greenpeace.ca/tarsands</a>.</p>

<p>The statistics used for the climate justice counter are based on averages derived from a variety of different sources listed below. They are not specific as it is very difficult to attribute any one specific event to the climate crisis but instead go up based on yearly averages. The statistics and additional information are listed below and come from the report: <a href="http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/climate_refugees_final.pdf" >No Place Like Home: Where next for climate refugees?</a></p>

<p><b>The Statistics</b><br />
Every year climate change is attributable for the deaths of over 300,000 people, seriously affects a further 325 million people, and causes economic losses of US$125 billion<sup>[3]</sup>. Four billion people are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and 500-600 million people &#151; around 10% of the planetâ€™s human population &#151; are at extreme risk<sup>[4]</sup>,<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>

<p>Already 26 million people have been displaced as a direct result of climate change<sup>[6]</sup>, by 2050, this number could grow to 200 million people<sup>[7]</sup>.</p>

<p>The most recent (2007) Assessment Report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that weather patterns have become more extreme, with more frequent and more intense rainfall events, more intense heat waves and prolonged droughts; the timing and location of rainfall has altered<sup>[8]</sup>. Weather-related disasters (storms, hurricanes, floods, heat waves and droughts) have more than doubled in number over the last 20 years<sup>[9]</sup>. There are now over 400 weather-related disasters per year and almost 90 million people require immediate assistance as a result; projections suggest that by 2030, this figure could be as high as 350 million<sup>[10]</sup>.</p>
